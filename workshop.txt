description=[b]Where do I find the journals?[/b] You craft them. The recipe can be found under "bind journal".

description=[b]How do I use the journal?[/b] You will see the option to "transcribe journal" when you have a writing tool and bound journal (that is unclaimed or you've written in before.) Trying to transcribe or read another person's journal in MP will not let you.

description=Journals have to be manually updated using a pen or pencil. You can check the tool-tip for XP and recipes. Careful if you die holding your journal as it may be difficult to retrieve it.
